# Advent of Code 2023

This repository contains my solutions in Rust to the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenges.

## Usage

To run the solutions, you need to have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) installed. Then you can run the solutions with:

```bash
cd day1 && cargo run --bin part_1
```

There's a Cargo project created for every day, with a `part_1` and `part_2` binary. The input is read from the `input` file in the project root.
